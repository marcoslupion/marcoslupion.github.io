To achieve this end, smart homes will have to be able to distinguish the identity of users, their location and the activities they are performing, while also being implemented in a non-invasive way that protects the privacy of these users. Computer vision is one of the main technologies included in smart homes. However, there are drawbacks to traditional cameras, given their dependence on light and privacy-related concerns. Thermal cameras provide a solution, as they operate regardless of light conditions (e.g. at night) while respecting users‚Äô privacy. In this work, image reconstruction and identification of inhabitants from facial images collected by low-resolution thermal sensors has been carried out by using Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (CGANs). The system has been implemented through an IoT device with raspberry Pi and dual-vision thermal and visible-spectrum sensors installed in a real smart home to automatically collect paired visible-spectrum and thermal images. Thus, different configurations of CGANs have been implemented and analyzed to achieve the following outcomes; (1) inhabitant identification (normal and masked face) with enhanced user privacy and (2) transfer from thermal to color images in the visible spectrum. Results show that the proposed CGAN achieves a recognition rate of 95% and 94% for uncovered and masked faces. This enables user identification without registering accurate facial expressions in the color image reconstruction, protecting user privacy. Furthermore, the developed system outperformed similar approaches using low-resolution datasets and has demonstrated that the accuracy of image reconstruction depends on the resolution of the input visible-spectrum images. In addition, a contribution to high-performance computing has been made by designing a CGAN that runs efficiently on multiple GPUs, achieving increased performance and response speed of the network, as well as applicability to larger problems.","tags":["Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)","Image translation","Thermal image","Face recognition","Privacy"],"title":"On the limits of Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to reconstruct the identification of inhabitants from IoT low-resolution thermal sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Lupi√≥n","Juan F.

However, the training of these networks remains unclear because it often results in unexpected behavior caused by non-convergence, model collapse or overly long training, causing the training task to have to be supervised by the user and vary with each dataset. To increase the speed of training in Pix2Pix (image-to-image translation) networks, this work incorporates multi-GPU training using mixed precision, along with optimizations in the GPU image input process. In addition, in order to make the training unsupervised and to terminate it when the best transformations are performed, an early stopping method using the peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) metric is proposed.","tags":["Generative adversarial networks","Pix2Pix","Multi-GPU","Mixed precision","Early stopping"],"title":"Using a Multi-GPU node to accelerate the training of Pix2Pix neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Lupi√≥n","Javier Medina-Quero","Juan F.

In this work, we present the on-line activity recognition platform DOLARS (Distributed On-line Activity Recognition System) where data from heterogeneous sensors are evaluated in real time, including binary, wearable and location sensors. Different descriptors and metrics from the heterogeneous sensor data are integrated in a common feature vector whose extraction is developed by a sliding window approach under real-time conditions. DOLARS provides a distributed architecture where (i) stages for processing data in AR are deployed in distributed nodes, (ii) temporal cache modules compute metrics which aggregate sensor data for computing feature vectors in an efficient way; (iii) publish-subscribe models are integrated both to spread data from sensors and orchestrate the nodes (communication and replication) for computing AR and (iv) machine learning algorithms are used to classify and recognize the activities. A successful case study of daily activities recognition developed in the Smart Lab of The University of Almer√≠a (UAL) is presented in this paper. Results present an encouraging performance in recognition of sequences of activities and show the need for distributed architectures to achieve real time recognition.","tags":["activity recognition","real-time","smart home","sliding windows","distributed system"],"title":"DOLARS, a Distributed On-Line Activity Recognition System by Means of Heterogeneous Sensors in Real-Life Deployments‚ÄîA Case Study in the Smart Lab of The University of Almer√≠a","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Lupi√≥n Lorente","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, there are many cases in which Ambient Assisted Living is being used, to control the health of the elderly people, or people with disabilities. In this paper, a proposal for an IoT system for activity recognition in a smart home will be shown. Specifically, various low-cost sensors are incorporated into a home that send data to the cloud. In addition, an activity recognition algorithm has been included to classify the information from the sensors and to determine which activity has been carried out. Results are also displayed in a web system, allowing the user to validate them or correct them. This web system allows the visualization of the data generated by the sensors of the smart home and help to easily monitor the activities carried out, and to alert to the doctors or the user‚Äôs family when bad habits or any problem in the behaviour are detected.","tags":["Ambient Assisted Living","Activity recognition","Machine learning algorithm"],"title":"Deployment of an IoT Platform for Activity Recognition at the UAL‚Äôs Smart Home","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.
