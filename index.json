New trends in Internet of Things approaches are now introduced to detect seizures in users with epilepsy to adjust treatments, reducing mortality rates due to the fatal consequences they develop. Wearable devices on the market can detect motor seizures thanks to their built-in acceleration sensors. However, the limitations of this type of device are the short battery life, a non-ergonomic design, and the high price. In this work, we propose a low-cost system that allows the monitoring of users in residential centers using a wearable device equipped with an acceleration sensor. The epileptic seizure detection algorithm has been built following federated machine learning, creating a general model for all possible users from the models learned in each residential center. Based on the first results, the system has more than 60 hours of autonomy, obtaining favorable detection rates in the first simulations. In this case, the information of each user is kept in the local environment, maintaining privacy.","tags":["Epilepsy Seizure Detection","Federated Machine Learning","Fog Computing","Low Cost Devices"],"title":" Epilepsy seizure detection using low-cost IoT devices and a federated machine learning algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

However, designing a neural network to address a particular problem is also a demanding task that requires expertise and time-consuming trial-and-error stages. The design of methods to automate the designing of neural networks define a research field that generally relies on different optimization algorithms, such as population meta-heuristics. This work studies utilizing Teaching-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO), which had not been used before for this purpose up to the authors' knowledge. It is widespread and does not have specific parameters. Besides, it would be compatible with deep neural network design, i.e., architectures with many layers, due to its conception as a large-scale optimizer. A new encoding scheme has been proposed to make this continuous optimizer compatible with neural network design. This method, which is of general application, i.e., not linked to TLBO, can represent different network architectures with a plain vector of real values. A compatible objective function that links the optimizer and the representation of solutions has also been developed. The performance of this framework has been studied by addressing the design of an image classification neural network based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The achieved result outperforms the initial solutions designed by humans after letting them evolve.","tags":["Artificial intelligence","Neural network architecture optimization","Meta-heuristics","Teaching-Learning-based optimization"],"title":"On optimizing the structure of neural networks through a compact codification of their architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Current results in the literature demonstrate that it is even possible to outperform designs by humans. In this field, the use of meta-heuristic global optimization algorithms is widespread. However, some of them, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), require the user to tune several parameters significantly affecting their performance. In this work, we propose using the Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm, which has been applied to numerous different problems. It looks for the optimal neural network architecture by simulating the learning process in a classroom with a teacher and several students. This algorithm has few parameters and supports high-dimensional problems. In addition, we present an encoding scheme that allows representing neural network architectures as vectors of real numbers. It is inspired by the transformation of N-Dimensional vectors to 1-Dimensional ones, which is frequent in high-performance computing. The target problem is challenging and computationally demanding. Thus, the proposed implementation assesses the candidate neural networks in parallel. Infeasible ones can be evaluated on CPUs. However, feasible neural networks, which must be trained with backpropagation and ultimately evaluated, should run on GPU since it is a more convenient computing platform in this context. The solution class is unknown in advance, so it is not advisable to distribute the load statically. Moreover, even feasible solutions running on GPUs might take different times to be evaluated because their complexities differ. Therefore, we propose the following two-phase evaluation approach i) a first evaluation on CPU using OpenMP to differentiate individuals with viable and non-viable architectures, and ii) a subsequent evaluation of GPU individuals using an oracle programmed in OpenMPI that dynamically distributes the load among GPUs. As preliminary results, the proposed method obtains neural network architectures that outperform known structures for the CIFAR10 dataset. Moreover, with the two-phase evaluation, a speedup of 4.2 is achieved over the sequential version, being the theoretical limit equal to 4.39 for the considered platform.","tags":["neural architecture search","multi-gpu","parallel computing"],"title":"On analyzing a parallel multi-GPU framework for the architecture optimization of neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Polo-Rodríguez","M.

To achieve this end, smart homes will have to be able to distinguish the identity of users, their location and the activities they are performing, while also being implemented in a non-invasive way that protects the privacy of these users. Computer vision is one of the main technologies included in smart homes. However, there are drawbacks to traditional cameras, given their dependence on light and privacy-related concerns. Thermal cameras provide a solution, as they operate regardless of light conditions (e.g. at night) while respecting users’ privacy. In this work, image reconstruction and identification of inhabitants from facial images collected by low-resolution thermal sensors has been carried out by using Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (CGANs). The system has been implemented through an IoT device with raspberry Pi and dual-vision thermal and visible-spectrum sensors installed in a real smart home to automatically collect paired visible-spectrum and thermal images. Thus, different configurations of CGANs have been implemented and analyzed to achieve the following outcomes; (1) inhabitant identification (normal and masked face) with enhanced user privacy and (2) transfer from thermal to color images in the visible spectrum. Results show that the proposed CGAN achieves a recognition rate of 95% and 94% for uncovered and masked faces. This enables user identification without registering accurate facial expressions in the color image reconstruction, protecting user privacy. Furthermore, the developed system outperformed similar approaches using low-resolution datasets and has demonstrated that the accuracy of image reconstruction depends on the resolution of the input visible-spectrum images. In addition, a contribution to high-performance computing has been made by designing a CGAN that runs efficiently on multiple GPUs, achieving increased performance and response speed of the network, as well as applicability to larger problems.","tags":["Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)","Image translation","Thermal image","Face recognition","Privacy"],"title":"On the limits of Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to reconstruct the identification of inhabitants from IoT low-resolution thermal sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Lupión","Juan F.

However, the training of these networks remains unclear because it often produces non-expected behaviour caused by non-convergence, model collapse or a training too long. Pix2pix are a kind of Generative Adversarial Networks that carry out image-to-image translation between two domains. In the original paper, in datasets which do not exceed 2,000 images the batch size is set to 1, obtaining good results with a not very high amount of training time. However, if datasets with a larger number of images are incorporated, a maximum batch size of 4 is used, causing the training to be slow. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the training by the use of high performance computing resources in order to be successful when training with huge databases. In the literature there are some approaches which aim to exploit the hardware platform where these algorithms are trained; in the most of cases, the GPU is chosen due to its high computing performance. In several approaches, some a multi-worker systems are implemented to adapt the batch size and learning rate parameters to optimize the use of GPUs in convolutional neural networks. However, no references of how efficiently train generative generative adversarial neural networks such as pix2pix are found. In this paper, we are going to focus on this problem and propose a new approach to accelerate the pix2pix problem by using modern MultiGPU architectures in Tensorflow. The new paralel model is described in detail so it can be used as guide for users. Some of the contributions made in the MultiGPU model are (a) the introduction of an optimized input pipeline that reduces the cost associated with loading data into the GPUs. (b) The introduction of the half-precision computation  to reduce the memory used in training. (c) The definition of new loss functions to correctly compute the neural networks losses in the MultiGPU node. These loss functions are different from the SingleGPU execution, as the amount of work is divided into two or more GPUs. (d) The definition of an early stopping method which stops when training completes before it gets worse. This method takes into account the distance between generator and discriminator loss in validation time.","tags":["Generative Adversarial Networks","pix2pix","MultiGPU","mixed-precision","early-stopping"],"title":"Accelerating Pix2Pix training using a multi-gpu node","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Lupión","Javier Medina-Quero","Juan F.
