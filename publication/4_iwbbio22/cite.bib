abstract="In this work, we propose the use of thermal vision sensors to estimate the frontal body landmarks of an inhabitant. The use of thermal sensors is being promoted to collect human patterns while protecting inhabitants' privacy in smart environments. On the other hand, deep learning approaches have provided encouraging results in estimating body, hand and facial landmarks. Here, we present a residual neural network which produces body landmarks from images collected by a low cost thermal sensor. In order to solve the problems of capturing and labeling data, which hinder learning in deep learning models, we propose an auto-labeling approach with dual visible-spectrum and thermal cameras, including the recognition of keypoints by the OpenPose model. A case study developed with four inhabitants in different poses shows encouraging results.",
