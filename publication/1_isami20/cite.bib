abstract="Currently, most smart homes are aimed at user comfort or even energy efficiency. However, there are many cases in which Ambient Assisted Living is being used, to control the health of the elderly people, or people with disabilities. In this paper, a proposal for an IoT system for activity recognition in a smart home will be shown. Specifically, various low-cost sensors are incorporated into a home that send data to the cloud. In addition, an activity recognition algorithm has been included to classify the information from the sensors and to determine which activity has been carried out. Results are also displayed in a web system, allowing the user to validate them or correct them. This web system allows the visualization of the data generated by the sensors of the smart home and help to easily monitor the activities carried out, and to alert to the doctors or the user's family when bad habits or any problem in the behaviour are detected.",
